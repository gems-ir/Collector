```

Or build in production mode:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin collector_cli
```

### Resources

You can download the collection resources here: [https://github.com/gems-ir/Resources.git](https://github.com/gems-ir/Resources.git) 

### Build packer

If you want to create a binary with pre-configuration, fill with your settings inside the "collector_packer_config.json" file.
Then, run the following command:

```bash
cd Collector
git clone https://github.com/gems-ir/Resources.git
cargo build --bin collector_packer --release
```

### Build under Linux

It is possible to build the rust project under Linux for Windows OS.
To do this, run the following command
```bash
apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 -y
apt-get install gcc -y
apt-get install build-essential -y
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```
after whcih you can build the project for example:
```bash
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --bin collector_cli --release
```

## Run collector

The project is designed to be easy to run.
You can simply launch the binary and the process will start.
